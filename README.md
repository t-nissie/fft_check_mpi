fft_check_mpi.F, a 3-dimensional FFT benchmark program written in Fortran with MPI
==================================================================================
fft_check_mpi.F is a benchmark program. It times in-place and
out-of-place double-precision real 3-dimensional FFT.
It is written in Fortran, using FFTW, parallelized with MPI.

FFTW
----
It is very important that machines have the *de facto standard* and
*ultra fast* FFT library, FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/> .

How to build fft_check_mpi
--------------------------
There are makefiles for some machines such as SR16000, FX10, etc.
Flat MPI and OpenMP+MPI hybrid parallelization versions of makefiles
are provided in flatMPI/ and hybrid/ directories.

    $ cd flatMPI; make -f Makefile.FX10-mpifrtpx
    $ cd hybrid;  make -f Makefile.SR16000-xlf90_r-fftw_xlc

How to execute fft_check_mpi
----------------------------
fft_check_mpi requires five command line arguments.
They are the number of iterations, Lx, Ly, Lz and
in-place (in) or out-of-place (out). For example,

    $ mpirun -np 8 ./fft_check_mpi 100 512 512 512 out

output, timing and GFLOPS
-------------------------
fft_check_mpi writes results into standard output (stdout).
A result contains Lx, Ly, Lz, N(=LxLyLz), in-place or out-of-place,
the number of OpenMP threads, the number of MPI processes, time for plan,
time for preparation, time for dummy loops, time for calculation,
and GFLOPS value.

Data for debug will be written into standard error output (stderr).

Giga FLOPS values are roughly estimated from 5N*log_2(N)/2 floating point operations.

Flat MPI vs. OpenMP+MPI hybrid parallelization
----------------------------------------------
fft_check_mpi.F can be compiled both in flat MPI and in OpenMP+MPI
hybrid parallelization. In many cases of large scale 3-dimensional FFT,
flat MPI is more efficient than hybrid parallelization.

and efficiency are listed.

    1440 node  hybrid      89.9 ms   5224.8 GFLOPS   1.5% (FFTW_PATIENT)

Padding
-------
If the numbers of dimensions of an array are powers of two,
for example r(2048,2048,2048), "bank conflict" may occur in FFT and
it reduces computational speed. To avoid "bank conflict",
"padding" is commonly introduced, for example r(2048,2048+3,2048).
However, introduction of "padding" make code complicated.
Therefore, "padding" is not introduced in this fft_check_mpi.F.

Compare 4096<sup>3</sup> and 4000<sup>3</sup> results of FX10 in the figure.

Initial dummy loops
-------------------
On some platforms, initial loops takes unpredictable time.
Therefore, fft_check_mpi.F wast 5 dummy loops in the beginning.

See "TLB miss" in <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer>.

fft_check, a benchmark program for single node

You can find a benchmark program for single node at
<http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/src/fft_check.html>.
fft_check is parallelized only with OpenMP.
